[ ] Cleanup
  [~] Do transitions need IDs? -> yes
  [x] Is it worth for transitions to have names? -> No
  [x] Remove :execution/event-metadata
  [ ] Remove :execution/comment
[ ] Organization
  [x] Namespacing to more unique reverse domain
  [x] Merge :end true and :return <Code>
  [ ] Smaller dependencies
[ ] Features
  [~] "Catch" exceptions -> have an if transition that forces output capturing
  [x] Trigger a step of a state machine from another state machine
  [ ] Streaming execution to another state machine
  [~] Retry failed executions -- NOTE(jeff): this can be done in a state machine or part of "catch" exceptions
  [ ] Upgrading Executions to new State Machine versions
  [ ] IO
    [ ] Can be mocked/replaced without modifying the state machine or execution
    [x] IO can only be used in specific transition
    [ ] All IO failures are reported back to the state machine
    [ ] Idempotency behavior for IO
  [ ] Validations
    [x] transition ids must be unique within a state
    [x] transition when must be unique within a state
    [ ] transitions that specify a state to jump to must exist within the state machine
  [ ] Consider Input handling?
